  computeLateralForce(slipAngleRadians, verticalLoadNewtons, inclinationAngleRadians, coefficientOfFriction, target): void
    Compute the lateral force (F_y) generated by the tire.

    @param {number} slipAngleRadians
        - The slip angle (alpha, in radians) of the tire. This is often a function of steering angle.

    @param {number} verticalLoadNewtons
        - The vertical load (F_z, in newtons) of the tire. This is often a function of vehicle weight.

    @param {number} inclinationAngleRadians
        - The inclination angle (in radians) of the tire. This is often a function of camber.

    @param {number} coefficientOfFriction
        - The coefficient of friction between the ground and the tire at the contact patch location.

    @param {Array.<number>} target
        - An array of length 4 to which this function's outputs will be copied. The first element is the lateral force. The second is an Shf value to be used in calculating aligning moment. The third is the computed B parameter, and the fourth is the computed C parameter.

  computeLongitudinalForce(slipRatio, verticalLoadNewtons, inclinationAngleRadians, coefficientOfFriction)
    Compute the longitudinal force (F_x) generated by the tire.

    @param {number} slipRatio
